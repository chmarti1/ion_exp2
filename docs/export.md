There are a number of `.png` files that are outputs of the various `postX.py` scripts.  These are the raw image files used to author the various publications relevant to this project.  Many of these images were merely investigatory and were never actually published.  In some cases, files with the same name, but a different type extension are included, but are not explicitly listed here.
